# Minimal configuration to ensure that Black does not convert quotes.
# Black does not support reading its configuration from `setup.cfg`.
# This file can be deleted when we convert to favoring double quotes.
# https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html

# NOTE: You have to use single-quoted strings in TOML for regular expressions.
# It's the equivalent of r-strings in Python.  Multiline strings are treated as
# verbose regular expressions by Black.  Use [ ] to denote a significant space
# character.
