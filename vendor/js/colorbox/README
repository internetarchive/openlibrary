RELEASE NOTES:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.3.3 - November 7 2009
Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js
* Changed $.fn.colorbox.element() to return a jQuery object rather the DOM element.
* jQuery.colorbox-min.js is compressed with Google's Closure Compiler rather than YUI Compressor.


Version 1.3.2 - October 27 2009
Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js
* Added IMG preloading to Ajax & HTML loading.  ColorBox now loops through supplied HTML to find IMG
  elements and loads them before attempting to calculate the dimensions of the content.
* Added 'innerWidth' and 'innerHeight' options to allow people to easily set the size dimensions for
  ColorBox, without having to anticipate the size of the borders and buttons.
* Renamed 'scrollbars' option to 'scrolling' to be in keeping with the existing HTML attribute.  The option
  now also applies to iframes.
* Bug fix: In Safari, positioning occassionally incorrect when using '100%' dimensions.
* Bug fix: In IE6, the background overlay is briefly not full size when first viewing.
* Bug fix: In Firefox, opening ColorBox causes a split second shift with a small minority of webpage layouts.
* Simplified code in a few areas.


Version 1.3.1 - September 16 2009
Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js/colorbox.css/colorbox-ie.css(removed)
* Removed the IE-only stylesheets and conditional comments for example styles 1 & 4.  All CSS is handled by
  a single CSS file for all examples.
* Removed user-agent sniffing from the js and replaced it with feature detection.  This will allow correct
  rendering for visitors masking their agent type.


Version 1.3.0 - September 15 2009
Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js/colorbox.css
* Added $.fn.colorbox.resize() method to allow ColorBox to resize it's height if it's contents change.
* Added 'scrollbars' option to allow users to turn off scrollbars when using the resize() method.
* Renamed the 'resize' option to be less ambiguous.  It's now 'scalePhotos'.
* Renamed the 'cbox_close' event to be less ambiguous.  It's now 'cbox_cleanup'.  It is the first thing to
  happen in the close method while the 'cbox_closed' event is the last to happen.
* Fixed a bug with the slideshow mouseover graphics that appeared after ColorBox is opened a 2nd time.
* Fixed a bug where ClearType may not work in IE6&7 if using the fade transition.
* Minor code optimizations to increase compression.


Version 1.2.9 - August 7 2009
Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js
* Minor change to enable use with $.getScript();
* Minor change to the timing of the 'cbox_load' event so that it is more useful.
* Added a direct link to a YouTube video to the examples.


Version 1.2.8 - August 5 2009
Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js
* Fixed a bug with the overlay in IE6
* Fixed a bug where left & right keypress events might be prematurely unbound.
* Removed focus return on closing because of potential problems in IE.


Version 1.2.7 - July 31 2009
Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js, example stylesheets and background images
(core styles have not changed and the updates will not affect existing user themes / old example themes)
* Code cleanup and reduction, better organization and documentation in the full source.
* Added ability to use functions in place of static values for ColorBox's options (thanks Ken!).
* Added an option for straight HTML.  Example: $.fn.colorbox({html:'<p>Howdy</p>', open:true})
* Added an event for the beginning of the closing process.  This is in addition to the event that already
  existed for when ColorBox had completely closed.  'cbox_close' and 'cbox_closed' respectively.
* Fixed a minor bug in IE6 that would cause a brief content shift in the parent document when opening ColorBox.
* Fixed a minor bug in IE6 that would reveal select elements that had a hidden visibility after closing ColorBox.
* The 'esc' key is unbound now when ColorBox is not open, to avoid any potential conflicts.
* Used background sprites for examples 1 & 4.  Put IE-only (non-sprite) background images in a separate folder.
* Example themes 1, 3, & 4 received slight visual tweaks.
* Optimized pngs for smaller file size.
* Added slices, grid, and correct sizing to the Adobe Illustrator file, all theme files are now export ready!


Version 1.2.6 - July 15 2009
Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js
* Fixed a bug with fixed width/height images in Opera 9.64.
* Fixed a bug with trying to set a value for rel during a direct call to ColorBox.
  Example: $.fn.colorbox({rel:'foo', open:true});
* Changed how href/rel/title settings are determined to avoid users having to manually update ColorBox
  settings if they use JavaScript to update any of those attributes, after ColorBox has been defined.
* Fixed a FF3 bug where the back button was disabled after closing an iframe.


Version 1.2.5 - June 23 2009
Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js/jquery.colorbox-min.js
* Changed the point at which iframe srcs are set (to eliminate the need to refresh the iframe once it has
  been added to the DOM).
* Removed unnecessary return values for a very slight code reduction.


Version 1.2.4 - June 9 2009
Files Changed: jquery.colorbox.js, jquery.colorbox-min.js
* Fixed an issue where ColorBox may not close completely if it is closed during a transition animation.
* Minor code reduction.


Version 1.2.3 - June 4 2009
* Fixed a png transparency stacking issue in IE.
* More accurate Ajax auto-sizing if the user was depending on the #cboxLoadedContent ID for CSS styling.
* Added a public function for returning the current html element that ColorBox is associated with.
  Example use: var that = $.fn.colorbox.element();
* Added bicubic scaling for resized images in the original IE7.
* Removed the IE6 stylesheet and png files from Example 3.  It now uses the same png file for the controls
  that the rest of the browsers use (an alpha transparency PNG8).  This example now only has 2 graphics
  files and 1 stylesheet.


Version 1.2.2 - May 28 2009
* Fixed an issue with the 'resize' option.


Version 1.2.1 - May 28 2009
* Note: If you are upgrading, update your jquery.colorbox.js and colorbox.css files.
* Added photo resizing.
* Added a maximum width and maximum height. Example: {height:800, maxHeight:'100%'}, would allow the box
  to be a maximum potential height of 800px, instead of a fixed height of 800px.  With maxHeight of 100%
  the height of ColorBox cannot exceed the height of the browser window.
* Added 'rel' setting to add the ability to set an alternative rel for any ColorBox call.  This allows the
  user to group any combination of elements together for a gallery, or to override an existing rel.
  attribute so those element are not grouped together, without having to alter their rel in the HTML.
* Added a 'photo' setting to force ColorBox to display a link as a photo.  Use this when automatic photo detection
  fails (such as using a url like 'photo.php' instead of 'photo.jpg', 'photo.jpg#1', or 'photo.jpg?pic=1')
* Removed the need to ever create disposable elements to call colorbox on.  ColorBox can now be called
  directly, without being associated with any existing element, by using the following format:
  $.fn.colorbox({open:true, href:'yourLink.xxx'});
* ColorBox settings are now persistent and unique for each element.  This allows for extremely flexible
  options for individual elements.  You could use this to create a gallery in which each page in the gallery
  has different settings.  One could be a photo with a fade transition, next could be an inline element
  with an elastic transition with a set width and height, etc.
* For user callbacks, 'this' now refers to the element colorbox was opened from.
* Fixed a minor grouping issue with IE6, when transition type is set to 'none'.
* Added an Adobe Illustrator file that contains the borders and buttons used in the various examples.


Version 1.2 - May 13 2009
* Note: If you are upgrading from a previous version of ColorBox, see the UPGRADE file.

* Added a slideshow feature.
* Added re-positioning on browser resize.  If the browser is resized, ColorBox will recenter itself onscreen.
* Added hooks for key events: cbox_open, cbox_load, cbox_complete, cbox_closed.
  Example of using the hooks to build a primitive sideshow:
  $().bind('cbox_complete', function(){
    setTimeout($.fn.colorbox.next, 1500);
  });
* Fixed an IE transparency-stacking problem, where transparent PNGs would show through to the background
  overlay.
* Fixed an IE iframe issue where the ifame might shift up and to the left under certain circumstances.
* Fixed an IE6 bug where the loading overlay was not at full height.
* Removed the delay in switching between same-sized gallery content when using transitions.
* Changed how iframes are loaded to make it more compatible with iframed pages that use DOM dependent
  JavaScript.
* Changed how the JS is structured to be better organized and increase compression.  Increased documentation.
* Changed CSS :hover states to a .hover class.  This sidesteps a minor IE8 bug with css hover states and
  allows easier access to hover state user styles from the JavaScript.
* Changed: elements added to the DOM have new ID's.  The naming is more consistent and less likely to cause
  conflicts with existing website stylesheets.  All stylesheets have been updated.
* Changed the behavior for prev/next links so that ColorBox does not get hung up on broken links.  A visitor
  can now skip through broken or long-loading links by clicking prev/next buttons.
* Changed the naming of variables in the parameter map to be more concise and intuitive.
* Removed colorbox.css.  Combined the colorbox.css styles with jquery.colorbox.js:
  the css file was not large enough to warrant being a separate file.


Version 1.1.6 - April 28 2009
* Prevented the default action of the next & previous anchors and the left and right keys for gallery mode.
* Fixed a bug where the title element was being added back to the DOM when closing ColorBox while using
  inline content.
* Fixed a bug where IE7 would crash for example 2.
* Smaller filesize: removed a small amount of unused code and rewrote the HTML injection with less syntax.
* Added a public method for closing ColorBox: $.fn.colorbox.close().  This will allow iframe users to
  add an event to close ColorBox without having to create an additional function.


Version 1.1.5 - April 11 2009
* Fixed minor issues with exiting ColorBox.
 

Version 1.1.4 - April 08 2009
* Fixed a bug in the fade transition where ColorBox not close completely if instructed to close during the
  fade-in portion of the transition.


Version 1.1.3 - April 06 2009
* Fixed an IE6&7 issue with using ColorBox to display animated GIFs.


Version 1.1.2 - April 05 2009
* Added ability to change content when ColorBox is already open.
* Added vertical photo centering now works for all browsers (this feature previously excluded IE6&7).
* Added namespacing to the esc-key keydown event for people who want to disable it: "keydown.colorClose"
* Added 'title' setting to add the ability to set an alternative title for any ColorBox call.
* Fixed rollover navigation issue with IE8. (Added JS-based rollover state due to a browser-bug.)
* Fixed an overflow issue for when the fixed width/height is smaller than the size of a photo.
* Fixed a bug in the fade transition where the border would still come up if ColorBox was
  closed mid-transition.
* Switch from JSMin to Yui Compressor for minification.  Minified code now under 7KB.


Version 1.1.1 - March 31 2009
* More robust image detection regex.  Now detects image file types with url fragments and/or query strings.
* Added 'nofollow' exception to rel grouping.
* Changed how images are loaded into the DOM to prevent premature size calculation by ColorBox.
* Added timestamp to iframe name to prevent caching - this was a problem in some browsers if the user had
  multiple iframes and the visitor left the page and came back, or if they refreshed the page.


Version 1.1.0 - March 21 2009
  Major Changes:
* Animation is now much smoother and less resource intensive.
* Added support for % sizing.
* Callback option added.
* Inline content now preserves JavaScript events, and changes made while ColorBox is open are also preserved.
* Added 'href' setting to add the ability to set an alternative href for any anchor, or to assign the
  ColorBox event to non-anchors. 
  Example: $('button').colorbox({'href':'process.php'})
  Example: $('a[href='http://msn.com']).colorbox({'href':'http://google.com', iframe:true});
 
  Minor Changes:
* Photos are now horizontally centered if they are smaller than the lightbox size.  Also vertically centered
  for browsers newer than IE7.
* Buttons in the examples are now included in the 'protected zone'.  The lightbox will never expand it's
  borders or buttons beyond an accessible area of the screen.
* Keypress events don't queue up by holding down the arrow keys.
* Added option to close ColorBox by clicking on the background overlay.
* Added 'none' transition setting.
* Changed 'contentIframe' and 'contentInline' to 'inline' and 'iframe'.  Removed 'contentAjax' because it
  is automatically assumed for non-image file types.
* Changed 'contentWidth' and 'contentHeight' to 'fixedWidth' and 'fixedHeight'.  These sizes now reflect
  the total size of the lightbox, not just the inner content.  This is so users can accurately anticipate
  % sizes without fear of creating scrollbars.
* Clicking on a photo will now switch to the next photo in a set.
* Loading.gif is more stable in it's position.
* Added a minified version.
* Code passes JSLint.


Version 1.0.5 - March 11 2009
* Redo: Fixed a bug where IE would cut off the bottom portion of a photo, if the photo was larger than
  the document dimensions.


Version 1.0.4 - March 10 2009
* Added an option to allow users to automatically open the lightbox. 
  Example usage: $(".colorbox").colorbox({open:true});
* Fixed a bug where IE would cut off the bottom portion of a photo,
  if the photo was larger than the document dimensions.


Version 1.0.3 - March 09 2009
* Fixed vertical centering for Safari 3.0.x.


Version 1.0.2 - March 06 2009
* Corrected a typo.
* Changed the content-type check so that it does not assume all links to photos should actually
  display photos.  This allows for Ajax/inline/and iframe calls on anchors linking to picture file types.


Version 1.0.1 - March 05 2009
* Fixed keydown events (esc, left arrow, right arrow) for Webkit browsers.


Version 1.0 - March 03 2009
* First release
