       All directories and paths are resolved relative to the

       Please note that <lib/> directives are processed in the order

       on top of each other when building a ClassLoader - so if you have
       plugin jars with dependencies on other jars, the "lower level"
       dependency jars should be loaded first.

       If a "./lib" directory exists in your instanceDir, all files
       found in it are included as if you had used the following
       syntax...

       (postingsFormat/docValuesFormat). Note that most of the alternative implementations
       are experimental, so if you choose to customize the index format, it's a good
       idea to convert back to the official format e.g. via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader)
       before upgrading to a newer version to avoid unnecessary reindexing.
       A "compressionMode" string element can be added to <codecFactory> to choose

  <!-- IndexReaderFactory

       Use the following format to specify a custom IndexReaderFactory,

       ** Experimental Feature **

       Please note - Using a custom IndexReaderFactory may prevent
       certain other features from working. The API to
       IndexReaderFactory may change without warning or may even be
       removed from future releases if the problems cannot be
       resolved.


       ** Features that may not work with custom IndexReaderFactory **

       The ReplicationHandler assumes a disk-resident index. Using a
       custom IndexReader implementation may cause incompatibility
       with ReplicationHandler and may cause replication to not work
       correctly. See SOLR-1366 for details.

    <!-- Memory Circuit Breaker

     Specific configuration for max JVM heap usage circuit breaker. This configuration defines
     whether the circuit breaker is enabled and the threshold percentage of maximum heap allocated
     beyond which queries will be rejected until the current JVM usage goes below the threshold.
     The valid value for this range is 50-95.

     Consider a scenario where the max heap allocated is 4 GB and memThreshold is defined as 75.
     Threshold JVM usage will be 4 * 0.75 = 3 GB. Its generally a good idea to keep this value
     between 75 - 80% of maximum heap allocated.

     If, at any point, the current JVM heap usage goes above 3 GB, queries will be rejected until
     the heap usage goes below 3 GB again. If you see queries getting rejected with 503 error code,
     check for "Circuit Breakers tripped" in logs and the corresponding error message should tell
     you what transpired (if the failure was caused by tripped circuit breakers).

  <!-- Request Dispatcher

       This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
       should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

    -->
  <requestDispatcher>
    <!-- Request Parsing

         These settings indicate how Solr Requests may be parsed, and
         what restrictions may be placed on the ContentStreams from
         those requests

         enableRemoteStreaming - enables use of the stream.file
         and stream.url parameters for specifying remote streams.

         multipartUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         Multipart File Uploads that Solr will allow in a Request.

         formdataUploadLimitInKB - specifies the max size (in KiB) of
         form data (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) sent via
         POST. You can use POST to pass request parameters not
         fitting into the URL.

         addHttpRequestToContext - if set to true, it will instruct
         the requestParsers to include the original HttpServletRequest
         object in the context map of the SolrQueryRequest under the
         key "httpRequest". It will not be used by any of the existing
         Solr components, but may be useful when developing custom
         plugins.

         *** WARNING ***
         Before enabling remote streaming, you should make sure your
         system has authentication enabled.

    <!-- If you include a <cacheControl> directive, it will be used to
         generate a Cache-Control header (as well as an Expires header
         if the value contains "max-age=")

         By default, no Cache-Control header is generated.

         You can use the <cacheControl> option even if you have set
         never304="true"
      -->

         Caching headers, and to response to Cache Validation requests
         correctly, set the value of never304="false"

         This will cause Solr to generate Last-Modified and ETag
         headers based on the properties of the Index.

         The following options can also be specified to affect the
         values of these headers...

         lastModFrom - the default value is "openTime" which means the
         Last-Modified value (and validation against If-Modified-Since
         requests) will all be relative to when the current Searcher
         was opened.  You can change it to lastModFrom="dirLastMod" if
         you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
         index was last modified.

         etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
         header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
         different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making
         significant changes to your config file)

         (lastModifiedFrom and etagSeed are both ignored if you use
         the never304="true" option)

       Search Handlers can also (append, prepend or even replace) default or defined Search Components.

       Update Request Handlers can leverage Update Request Processors to pre-process documents after they are loaded
       and before they are indexed/stored.

       Not all Request Handlers are defined in the solrconfig.xml, many are implicit.

     Could be something like:
     <transformer name="db" class="com.mycompany.LoadFromDatabaseTransformer" >
       <int name="connection">jdbc://....</int>
     </transformer>

     To add a constant value to all docs, use:
     <transformer name="mytrans2" class="org.apache.solr.response.transform.ValueAugmenterFactory" >
       <int name="value">5</int>
     </transformer>

     If you want the user to still be able to change it with _value:something_ use this:
     <transformer name="mytrans3" class="org.apache.solr.response.transform.ValueAugmenterFactory" >
       <double name="defaultValue">5</double>
     </transformer>

      If you are using the QueryElevationComponent, you may wish to mark documents that get boosted.  The
      EditorialMarkerFactory will do exactly that:
     <transformer name="qecBooster" class="org.apache.solr.response.transform.EditorialMarkerFactory" />
    -->
</config>
