# Goal: Create a program that can separate Jsons out into diffs. Here's what I need:

# I need to know all keys added in the second commit.  (Keys of set B that are not in set A.)
# I need all keys added in that commit. (Keys of A that are not in the set of keys of B)
# I need all keys changed. Now, changes can have specific qualities, based on the types of key:
# Potential types of the key: Single Value (Boolean, String, Number, null)-- these can only be deleted or changed.
#                             Array (convert the values into sets, and compare them.)
#                           Dict: Recurse.
# Therefore, I need to define a few elements/operations. INSERT KEY (value) and DELETE KEY( value).
#
# So, let's examine this in cases. What does it actually mean to undo an action? We have 3 types of values.
# STAGES FOR UNDOING:
#       undoing an add
#               -simple case: delete if not changed or deleted in a later diff.
#               -add an element to a list- search that list for that element, and if it's there, delete it.
#               - adding a dictionary- delete all keys that were added with the new dict.  If said dict is then empty, delete it.
#        undoing a delete:
#               simple case: add back the key:value pair that was deleted, if it was not added again by a later dict
#               deleted from a list: append that element back to the list.
#               deleted a key from a dict: add that key and value back, if it does not already exist.
#       undoing a replace
#               simple case: return to the previous version's value
#               lists: ???? if all goes well, a list changing should never occur, it will only have elements of it being added or deleted.
#               dicts: revert all key:Values within the dict back to normal, if they are not touched by the later commit.
# Replace:
#       Do I want a recursive definition? Quite possibly. After all, if it's recursive,
#          it will properly allow me to deal with all sorts of potential structures. Now, problem-- how do I handle this data?
# How do I have the paths properly?
# Thought -> Pass the appropriate prefix into the function. Then-- Okay, let's just Haskell it.
# On internal dict: [f'{prefix}/{newKey}' for newKey in diffDict()]


# Stages for recording changes: Simple keys/values, easyy.
# Let's see about lists now. We have two types, ordered and unordered.
# This will be tricky-ish. How will I accomplish this?  Let's assume that Patches aren't (usually) manually created,
# And usually only function from diff_dicts, and the like. This way, we have an easy pipeline to go to work with, and can potentially ignore some inconveniences.
# So let's see. Desired behavior when performing the Add operation:
#              - If adding a simple key value, check if the key already exists.  If it doesn't exist, add it.
#              - If adding a value to a list, check to see if there's an index argument. If not, append it to the end of the list.
#              - If navigating to a value that doesn't exist, create keys on the way to what doesn't exist.  This begs the question, should it be a different type
#                             to add to arrays? I think maybe, yes actually-- I like the idea of that.
# Yeah, the elegant way to do this is to remove Replace, and instead use a variety of insert keys, but is that invertible? Let's think about it this way.
#              - Is the insert method invertible? It certainly is, it is undone by pop.
# Alright, I think I need to bite the bullet, and use the 'path' method. Okay.  This way, each add is responsible for a single data point.
# This is a pitfall. Alright, I think I need to be careful, because the problem with this,
# is that 'adding to a dict is an intrinsically separate operation from adding to a list.
# But both use the same way of indexing in. How can I avoid ambiguity, here? Do I need to avoid it?
#    Let's say that I'm adding to it with a key.
# Alright, back to breaking down the types of adding.
#         - Adding a dict key and value.
#         - Adding an element to a list (orderless)
#         - Adding an element to a list (ordered)
from copy import deepcopy
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from contextlib import suppress
from typing import Literal
import pytest

# When should an Add be inverted?  And what does it mean, what's the desired behavior?
# The desired behavior is split into three sections.
#       -normal data type: if the value still matches the value from the add, then it should be deleted.  If it was a complex data type, then ...
#           all keys matching it should be changed? No, that doesn't sound right. Let's consider the scenario where I've added in an author name.
#           deleting this is relatively trivial. If the author name is still noted at that address, then, remove it.
# Alright, I think this might benefit from splitting it up into two
# different typese for adds/deletes respectively. Also, worth noting-- this is going to
# find the fastest solution regardless, so there will not be unnecessary in betweens-- and even if they are, they'll be governed by order
# Information needed to see if an Add should be undone (because it's a function on this add, all of this needs to be available to deletes. ):
#                   - The path of the value to check.
#                   - Is the value in a list?  (This is checkable in function.)
#                           - If so, if it's unordered, then remove the first
#                       instance of it in the list. Do nothing if the element is not in the list.
#                           - If the list is ordered, then ????? [[return later]] (This will
#               need to be aware of intermediary changes, so I think I'll have to actually
#                                generate and compare/add the diffs together of the next function.)
#                   - If the value's not in a list, then just check if it matches the old value. if it does, then delete it.

# Alright, let's consider what total tests we might need. Here are the things that can go wrong:
# Let's define the different error possibilities.
#       Error 1: The type is no longer applicable (relevant key has changed type.
#       Error 2: Item no longer exists in the unordered list.
#       Error 3: Item no longer has the right index in the ordered list. (DIFFICULT TO MANAGE, THIS WILL BE THE PROBLEM)
#               HOW TO SOLVE THIS: keep track of the index shifting that occurs between version_to_undo and latest_version.
#                  What this means: I need a list of edits that map one number to another. So how am I going to do this? Does 'find shared sequences' work? It might.
#       This error is also going to show up with complex nested lists/dicts, so how am I going to do this? I need a new stage in 'invert' that generates mappings:
#       Mappings will be a way of mapping old indexes to new indexes. The new index can be null, so None can be an option. For example.
#   [1,2, 3, 4] [2, 3, 4] is a mapping of {1: None, 2:0, 3:1, 4:2}. However, it'd be better if I find a way to describe it using ranges, for better performance.
#  The mapping is not actually going to be a tool for matching the same item, but a way of describing to the list the shifts that have been made to other item's locations.
# This means that I will need a new object type, because lists won't actually cut it here.
