# Rule exclusions
# LT01: Inconsistent whitespace (prevents spacing-only diffs)
# LT02: Indentation not consistent (prevents massive re-tabbing)
# LT03: Unnecessary whitespace (around operators/keywords)
# LT04: Leading/trailing layout (comma placement)
# LT05: Line breaks (forcing newlines after commas)
# LT06: Blank lines (enforcing vertical spacing)
# LT07: Spacing after commas
# LT08: Comment spacing (forcing space after --)
# LT09: Keyword layout (spacing around specific SQL words)
# LT10: Select clause layout (forcing one column per line)
# LT11: Union/set operator layout
# LT12: No newline required after SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.
# LT14: FROM/WHERE/ORDER BY should be on new lines
# AL01: Aliasing of table names (forcing 'AS')
# AL02: Aliasing of column names (forcing 'AS')
# AL03: Column aliases should use 'AS'
# AL04: Table aliases should use 'AS'
# AL05: Column aliases should not use 'AS'
# L010: Keywords should be capitalised consistently
# L011: Implicit aliasing of table names is prohibited
# L012: Implicit aliasing of columns is prohibited
# L014: Inconsistent capitalisation of unquoted identifiers
# L016: Line too long
# L018: Parentheses should not be needed
# L019: Leading/Trailing whitespace not allowed
# L020: Block indentation not consistent
# L025: Keywords should not be used as identifiers
# L028: Unnecessary whitespace around commas
# L030: Inconsistent spacing around operators
# L031: Avoid using aliases that are the same as the table name
# L034: Use wildcard field selection explicitly or prohibit it
# L035: Explicit specification of JOIN type
# RF04: Indentation should be consistent
# RF06: Whitespace before/after commas should be consistent
# RF02: Lines should be shorter than max length
# AM04: Usage of DISTINCT inside aggregate functions
# CP04: Boolean/null literals must be consistently lower case (prevents NULL vs null diffs)
# CP05: Datatypes must be consistently lower case (prevents INT vs int diffs)
# LT13: Files must not begin with newlines or whitespace (keeps original file padding)
# AL09: Column should not be self-aliased (prevents removing redundant 'AS col' name)
# AM05: Join clauses should be fully qualified (allows simple column names in JOINS)
# ST08: Select statement should not reorder columns (prevents breaking CSV dump order)
# L035: Join clauses should be explicit (prevents forcing INNER JOIN where JOIN was used)
# CP05: Datatypes must be consistently lower case (prevents INT vs int diffs)
