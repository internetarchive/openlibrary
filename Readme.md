## Overview

Open Library is an effort started in 2006 to create "one web page for every book ever published." It provides access to many public domain and out-of-print books, which can be read online.

Here's a quick public tour of Open Library to get you familiar with the service and its offerings (10min).

### Developer's Guide

For instructions on administrating your Open Library instance, refer to the Developer's [Quickstart](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Getting-Started) Guide.

You can also find more information regarding Developer Documentation for Open Library in the Open Library [Wiki](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/).

## Code Organization

* openlibrary/core - core openlibrary functionality, imported and used by www
* openlibrary/plugins - other models, controllers, and view helpers
* openlibrary/views - views for rendering web pages
* openlibrary/templates - all the templates used in the website
* openlibrary/macros - macros are like templates, but can be called from wikitext

## Architecture

### The Backend

OpenLibrary is developed on top of the Infogami wiki system, which is itself built on top of the web.py Python web framework and the Infobase database framework.

- [Overview of Backend Web Technologies](https://openlibrary.org/about/tech)

Once you've read the overview of OpenLibrary Backend technologies, it's highly encouraged you read the developer primer which explains how to use Infogami (and its database, Infobase).

- [Infogami Developer Tutorial](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/infogami)

If you want to dive into the source code for Infogami, see the [Infogami repo](https://github.com/internetarchive/infogami).

## Running tests

Open Library tests can be run using docker. Kindly look up on our [Testing Document](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Testing) for more details.

```
docker compose run --rm home make test
```
