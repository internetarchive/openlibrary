  "description": "Americans spend billions on self-help products, yet few people are living the life they really want. The real problem, says productivity expert Noah St. John, is that most people focus on the \"how-to\" aspects of success without coming to terms with what calls your \"head trash\"-the subconscious, emotional roadblocks that prevent people from acting on their real hopes, dreams, and ambitions. St. John has created a seven-step approach that helps you learn how to: eliminate the causes of self-sabotage and fear of success; allow yourself to make more money; remove stress while dramatically increasing personal productivity; improve relationships with coworkers, family, and friends; and experience enhanced feelings of happiness, connection, and love.--From publisher description.",
