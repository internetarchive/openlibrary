Crash course Library of Congress Classification (LCC)

Examples:
 - HB1951 .R64 1995
 - DP402.C8 O46 1995
 - CS879 .R3 1995
 - NC248.S22 A4 1992
 - TJ563 .P66 1998
 - PQ3919.2.M2866 C83 1994
 - NA2500 .H64 1995
 - DT423.E26 9th.ed. 2012
 - PZ73.S758345255 2011
 - PZ8.3.G276Lo 1971

Has 3 parts:
 1. The class number: e.g. PQ3919.2 ; should match `[A-Z]{1,3}(\\d{1,4}(\\.\\d+)?)?`
 2. Cutter number(s): e.g. .M2866 C83
 3. Specification: Basically everything else, e.g. 2012, 9th.ed. 2012

### 1. The Class Number
The class number is what's used to determine the Library of Congress Subject. It has
a pretty well-defined structure, and should match `[A-Z]{1,3}(\\d{1,4}(\\.\\d+)?)?`

For example:
 - QH -> Biology
 - QH426-470 -> Genetics

_Note_: According to [1] (page 36), the first cutter is sometimes considered a part of
the class number. But this isn't discussed in [2], so it seems like it might not be
entirely well-defined.

### 2. Cutter Numbers
Cutter numbers are a somewhat phonetic hashing of a piece of "extra" information like
author last name, city, or whatever. Each character maps to a letter range, so for
example:
  - Idaho -> I33 -> I[d][a-d]
  - Campbell -> C36 -> C[a][m-o]

For the full mapping of character to letter ranges, see [1] Appendix B1 (page 355).

Because the number part of a cutter number maps to letters, even the numeral is sorted
lexicographically, so for example this is the correct sorting:
    [I2, I23, I3], **not** [I2, I3, I23]

In essence they are sort of sorted as if they were decimal numbers.

### 3. Specification

These aren't very well defined and could be just about anything. They usually include at
least the publication year of the edition, but might include edition numbers.

## Sorting

To get _fully_ sortable LCCs, you likely need to use a multipart scheme (as described in
[2]). That's not really feasible for our Solr instance (especially since we store info
at the work level, which likely has multiple LCCs). The added complexity of that
approach is also not immediately worth it right now (but might be in the future).

As a compromise, we make the class number and the first cutter sortable by making the
class number fixed-width. For example:
 - PZ73.S758345255 2011 -> PZ-0073.00000000.S758345255 2011
 - PZ8.3.G276Lo 1971    -> PZ-0008.30000000.G276Lo 1971

This allows for range queries that could include the first cutter. It sorts incorrectly
if:
  - The decimal of the class number is longer than 8 digits (few such cases in OL db)
  - The sort is determined by information that appears after the first cutter
  - The first cutter is a "double cutter", e.g. B945.D4B65 199

But it works for subject-related range queries, so we consider it sufficient.
