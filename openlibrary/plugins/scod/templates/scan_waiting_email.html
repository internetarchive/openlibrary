$var subject: Your Scan Request, $book.title, is being retreived

Hi $scan_record.sponsor.displayname!

We are sending this mail to inform you that the scan of the book "$book.title", that you have requested has entered the scan queue. A librarian will get the book from the stacks and bring it to our scanning center.

We will notify you when the scan is in progress, or if for some reason your scan cannot be completed.
