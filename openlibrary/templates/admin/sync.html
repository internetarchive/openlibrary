  <h2>Add Works to Staff Picks</h2>
  <p>This utility will add your work to an Open Library list called `Staff Picks` under the `openlibrary` user. It will then take the added work and explode it into a list of all its readable editions. For each Open Library edition, a metadata field called `openlibrary_subject` will be injected into the archive.org metadata of the edition's corresponding archive.org item.
