$var subject: Open Library Username/Password reminder

Hi there,

It looks like you need a nudge to either remember your Open Library username, or to reset your password.

Your Open Library username is: $username
Your email on the account is: $email

And, if you've forgotten your password as well, just click the link below to get to a page on Open Library where you can reset it:

Good luck!
