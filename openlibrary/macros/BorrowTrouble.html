    <h3>Trouble Downloading?</h3>
    <p class="small sansserif">Our records indicate that you've borrowed a book, but have <span class="red">not yet downloaded</span> it. In order to keep our books available to everyone, you'll have a 5-minute window to load your borrowed book into Adobe Digital Editions. After that period, we return the book to the shelf.</p>

        <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/#fp" title="Get the reader" target="new_window">Digital Editions</a> is required for this book. Adobe provides support for <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/403/kb403051.html" target="new_window">installation problems</a>.</li> 
        <li>To download the application, Adobe also requires that <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="new_window">Adobe Flash Player</a> is installed in your web browser.</li>
        <li>An <a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/membership/index.cfm" target="new_window">Adobe Account</a> will allow you to download borrowed books to different computers.</li>
        <li>After fully installing the software, locate the borrowed book file (ePub or PDF) on your computer. It will have an .acsm extension.</li>
        <li>Open the book by double-clicking on its file. This should automatically open Digital Editions and add the book to your library. If not, you may need to associate .acsm files with the application, but you only need to do that once.</li>
        <li>If the book was not downloaded into your Digital Editions library, your loan may have expired. Simply re-borrow the book and open it again.</li>
