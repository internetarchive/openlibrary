### Code of Conduct

Before continuing, please familiarize yourself with our [code of conduct](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
We are a non-profit, open-source, inclusive project, and we believe everyone deserves a safe place to make the world a little better. We're committed to creating this safe place.

### Join our Community

* The core Open Library team communicates over an invite-only Slack channel. You may request an invitation on our [volunteers](https://openlibrary.org/volunteer) page.
* The Open Library hosts weekly video calls. Check the [community call page](https://docs.openlibrary.org/1_Everyone/Community-Call.html) for times and details.

## Installing Open Library
For instructions on setting up a local developer's instance of Open Library, please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary#installation).

[![archive org_details_openlibrary-developer-docs_zoom_0 mp4_autoplay=1 start=2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/978325/91351305-ef10ee00-e79c-11ea-9bfb-c2733696ec58.png)](https://archive.org/details/openlibrary-developer-docs/zoom_0.mp4)

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki) for more information about getting set up, understanding the codebase, contributing, and more.  Check out the sidebar for links to relevant topics.

[Here's a handy cheat sheet](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Git-Cheat-Sheet) if you are new to using Git.

## Common Setup Tasks

### Adding Data to Open Library
- If you are looking to add data using MARC and ONIX records, visit [Open Library Bots](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary-bots).

## Submitting Issues

[Interacting with GitHub Issues](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki#using-github) and 
[Using Managed Labels to Track Issues](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki#managed-labels-by-group) 
explain how GitHub issues are triaged, labeled, and prioritized.

### Tagging
- If an issue requires immediate fixing, please include a comment requesting for it to be labeled and promoted as [`Priority: 0`](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Priority%3A+0%22+).

## Picking Good First Issues

[Here's a list of good first issues](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-linked%3Apr+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22+no%3Aassignee) to help you get started. Please only pick issues that are not assigned to anyone, or if an issue has been assigned but has seen no response or activity for 2 weeks. Do not request to be assigned to issues that are actively being worked on. If you're interested in working on an issue without an assignee or one that has been inactive, comment on it to ask if you can be assigned.  If you have questions, please ask the [Lead](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/wiki/Using-Managed-Labels-to-Track-Issues#triage) designated by the `Lead: @person` label on the issue.

## Contributor Etiquette

We value all contributors and want to ensure a positive and collaborative environment. Please follow these guidelines:

### Respecting Other Contributors' Work
- **Do not undermine others' efforts**: If someone has already asked to work on an issue and been assigned (or is actively working on it), please respect their effort. Opening a competing PR without coordination undermines their contribution and violates our community spirit.
- **Check before starting**: Before beginning work on an issue, check if someone else is already assigned or has recently expressed interest in working on it.

### Requesting Issue Assignments
- **Quality over quantity**: Please do not ask to be assigned to dozens of issues at a time. Focus on making meaningful contributions rather than accumulating assignments.
- **Demonstrate understanding**: When requesting to be assigned to an issue, show that you understand the problem by including:
  - A summary of the challenge or bug
  - Your proposed approach to solving it
  - Which files or components you plan to modify
  - Any questions you have about the implementation
- **Use AI tools responsibly**: While you're encouraged to use AI tools (like LLMs) to assist with research and understanding the codebase, please don't simply copy-paste AI-generated responses into your comments. Take time to understand the suggestions and present them in your own words, demonstrating genuine comprehension of the issue.

### Our Roadmap(s)
You can see this year (and previous year's) roadmap(s) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KJr3A81Gew7nfuyo9PnCLCjNBDs5c7iR4loOGm1Pafs/edit).

## Development Practices

### Branch Names
Whenever working on a new feature/hotfix/refactor, make sure a corresponding issue exists.
We use the issue number in the branch name.

A branch name consists of the: issue number, whether it is a feature/hotfix/refactor, and a human readable slug, e.g:

```
123/refactor/simplifying-authentication-using-xauthn
```

### Testing
See https://docs.openlibrary.org/2_Developers/misc/Testing.html for more information.

## pre-commit hooks

Be confident in changing files you can check the quality (linter) with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/index.html).
It is used to inspect the snapshot that is about to be committed, to see if there are any syntax errors, typos, or a handful of other common issues.
You can see the actions descriptions in [pre-commit-config.yml](https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml).

The pre-commit is automatically run against open PRs. Install the pre-commit locally to avoid waiting for the PR checks to run in the cloud.

### Installation

```
pip install pre-commit
# or on mac you can run
brew install pre-commit
```

After executing the last command, when you normally run `git commit`, pre-commit will also perform its checks.

### Running manually

```
pre-commit run --files pre-commit-config.yml
```

> **_Warning:_**  If you don't clone with **ssh** then infogami will have pre-commit issues [You can read this section to resolve it](docker/README.md#cloning-the-open-library-repository).


### Submitting Pull Requests

Once you've finished making your changes, submit a pull request (PR). Please take the time to check whether someone has already raised the issue you are solving. Thank you for your contributions!

Follow these rules when creating a PR:

1. **Test your code before opening a PR**: Maintainers may close your PR if it has clearly not been tested.
2. **Follow the pull request template**: It's easier for a maintainer to reject a PR than it is for them to fill it out for you.
3. **Make PRs _self-contained_**: They should clearly describe what changes have taken place. A reviewer should (for the most part) be able to complete a review without having to look at other issues.
4. **Resolve all code review (CR) comments**: Treat comments as a todo list. Most PRs will require some edits before getting merged, so don't get discouraged if you have to make some changes!
5. **Reply when resolving CR comments**: When resolving a comment, reply with either "DONE" or "WON'T FIX because ...". A reviewer will unresolve a comment if they feel it's necessary.
