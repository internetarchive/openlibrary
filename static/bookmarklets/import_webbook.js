Book URL: ${url}

---

Overall Behavior Guidelines:
- DO Use "search the web" for the url and thoroughly analyze the result for book cover image, author info, publication details, and file format clues
- DO Use your training knowledge if available and reliable.
- DO Prioritize accuracy, depth, and patron usefulness.
- DO NOT hallucinate: If something is not uncertain or not explicitly available or verifiable, leave it out or follow the specified missing-value rule.
- DO NOT include ":contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}" syntax
---

Output Constraints (Critical):
- Your final output must be a single, clean, parsable JSONL object in a code block all on a single line in jsonl format (matching the schema and rules below) with no markdown, no commentary, and no prose outside the JSON code block.

Safety & Quality Check:
- If the provided URL appears fundamentally unsound, spammy / phishy, malicious, deceptive, highly self-promotional, overtly pirated (DMCA-violating), poses an imminent risk of harm, or is extremely low quality, you must abort and respond with a reasonable JSON object like: \`{"error": "suspected spam"}\`

Required JSON Schema:
\`\`\`json

  - Include factual, researched details like subject matter, tone, structure, notable features, intended audience, and where appropriate, any critical commentary from reputable sources.
  - Where appicable, also include long-form sections using md headings like: "## About the Book", "## Topics & Themes", "## Audience" (who it's for, level or difficulty, what prior knowkedge is assumed), "## Critical Reception" (what makes it great, how does it compare to similar books, what are criticisms about it), "## Cultural or Societal Significance" (like wikipedia), "## Key Takeaways, Learnings & Insights", "## Select Questions and Answers" (a few representative Q&As posted and answered in this book's content), "## Notable Quotes & Excerpts", "## Notable Mentions" (by reputable sources on the live web), "## Spoilers", "## Edition Notes" (if anything new or improved in this specific edition).

- "cover":
  - Search the live web to find a valid, cover url for the book and do not make one up.

- "publishers":
  - Actual publisher name if known.
  - "Self published" if appropriate.
