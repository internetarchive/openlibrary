# Storybook

We are documenting our components [here](https://internetarchive.github.io/openlibrary/).

## Running Storybook locally

In the project's root directory, run `npm run storybook` to view stories on your machine.  You can view the stories at http://localhost:6006.

## Building Storybook for deployment

Running `npm run build-storybook` in the project's root directory will result in a deployable instance being built in the `storybook-static` directory.
